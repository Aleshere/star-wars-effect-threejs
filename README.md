# Star Wars Effect on Three.js

### I had a little of background, from previous projects, about objects moving within a canvas, but I saw this one project and looked cool (I am a fan of the original Star Wars movies).

# What I have learned building this

> THREE Perspective Camera rotational and positional coordinates  
> Loop and Math.Random to create randomized sized objects  
> Window resize utility   
> forEach to animate the stars, and reposition them once beyond visualization
